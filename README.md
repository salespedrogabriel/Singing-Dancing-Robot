## Description
Repository of the interface module related to the Final Project carried out during the ENG1419 - Microcontroller Programming course at PUC-Rio 2022.2

## Interface - MP3 Player

MP3 Player for Microcontroller Programming - ENG1419 at Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro

## What it is?

This is a .mp3 music player that will support a robot to dance and sing. 

## How it works?

This Player will help a robot play songs that are stored in the program. The songs and lyrics folder are not included in this repository. When a song is played, it shows the lyrics in his belly and song metrics like vocals, drums, piano levels and the robot will move and his eye lights will adapt to it to match the song.
